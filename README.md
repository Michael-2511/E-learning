I developed a Java application for managing an e-learning platform, including functionalities for handling courses, users, students, and quizzes. The application uses Java collections for data management and sorting, and it implements principles of inheritance and encapsulation. Key features include the management of users, courses, and quizzes, data persistence using JDBC and a relational database, and CRUD operations for the main objects. Additionally, it features an audit service that logs actions in CSV files.
