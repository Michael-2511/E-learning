I developed a Java application for managing an e-learning platform, including functionalities for handling courses, users and quizzes. Key features include the management of users, courses, and quizzes, data persistence using JDBC and a relational database, and CRUD operations for the main objects. Additionally, it features an audit service that logs actions in a CSV file.
